# WeatherMap

To run: 
- Install cocoapods (iOS package manager): https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html
- run `pod install` in the project root
- Open the WeatherMap.xcworkspace file (not the WeatherMap.xcodeproj file, the workspace has all the cocoapods dependencies)
- Run the app in simulator!
